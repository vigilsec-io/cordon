# Valca

**AI coding security co-pilot — blocks insecure code at the moment of generation.**

> **Formerly published as `vigilsec`.** The package is now `valca`. Both the `valca` and `vigil`
> commands work, so existing hooks and scripts keep running unchanged.

Valca intercepts every file an AI coding assistant writes and blocks it if CRITICAL or HIGH security findings are detected — before the file hits disk. It's the only tool that operates at generation time rather than post-commit.

```
AI writes file → valca scan → exit 2 → Claude Code blocks the write
```

---

## The Problem

AI coding assistants reproduce the most common patterns in their training data. The most common patterns are insecure defaults.

The clearest example: every existing IaC scanner (Checkov, Trivy, Snyk, Semgrep) misses the docker-compose port binding that exposes your database to the internet:

```yaml
ports:
  - "5432:5432"   # ← binds to 0.0.0.0, bypasses UFW, reachable from anywhere
```

The correct form is `"127.0.0.1:5432:5432"`. Valca catches it. Nothing else does.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install valca
```

**Wire the Claude Code hook (one time):**

```bash
valca init --global     # `valca init --global` also works
```

That's it. Every file Claude Code writes is now scanned before it saves. Reload Claude Code to activate.

---

## Network access

Valca's core scanning is fully offline — the package has **zero runtime dependencies** and the
engine never sends your code, file paths, or findings anywhere.

Three rules do reach the network, because checking whether a dependency is vulnerable or fabricated
is impossible offline. When a manifest (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`, lockfiles) is scanned,
these rules send **package names and version strings only** to:

| Host | Used by | What is sent |
|---|---|---|
| `api.osv.dev` | VGL-PKG001 (known CVE in a pinned version) | package name + version |
| `pypi.org` | VGL-PKG002/003/004 (hallucinated, stale, or suspicious package) | package name |
| `registry.npmjs.org` | VGL-PKG002/003/004 | package name |

Your source code, file contents, file paths, and scan results are never transmitted. If your
dependency inventory is itself sensitive, turn these rules off in `.vigilrc` and Valca runs
completely offline:

```ini
disabled_rules = ["VGL-PKG001", "VGL-PKG002", "VGL-PKG003", "VGL-PKG004"]
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Scan a single file
valca scan docker-compose.yml

# Scan a directory
valca scan ./my-project/

# JSON output (for CI / dashboards)
valca scan ./my-project/ --format json

# SARIF output (for GitHub Advanced Security)
valca scan ./my-project/ --format sarif > results.sarif

# Only report HIGH and above
valca scan ./my-project/ --severity HIGH

# Open feedback & waitlist form
valca feedback
```

**Review what has been caught over time.** Both commands read the local scan
history — nothing leaves your machine.

```bash
# Findings log — what was caught, where, and when
valca log                              # 20 most recent findings
valca log --severity CRITICAL          # only criticals
valca log --project api --since 2026-09-01
valca log --limit 100 --format json    # for dashboards

# Aggregate stats — rule frequency, severity mix, precision per rule
valca stats
valca stats --format json
```

`valca stats` reports how often each rule fires and how often you suppressed it,
so rules with poor precision in *your* codebase are visible rather than guessed at.

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | No findings — write proceeds |
| `1` | Advisory findings only (MEDIUM / LOW / INFO) |
| `2` | CRITICAL or HIGH found — **Claude Code blocks the write** |

---

## See It in Action

**Blocking a vulnerable GitHub Actions workflow at write time:**

<!-- GIF: terminal showing claude writing ai-review.yml → vigil hook fires → BLOCKED + VGL-GHA009 CRITICAL → fix applied → clean -->
![Valca blocking a Comment-and-Control attack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vigilsec-io/cordon/main/docs/demo-gha.gif)

In April 2026, researchers found that all three major AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Copilot) could be hijacked to exfiltrate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` via a hidden HTML comment in a GitHub issue. CVSS 9.4. No special access required.

Valca catches the vulnerable workflow (`issues:` trigger + AI agent + API key in env) before it reaches git — the only tool that does.

## Configuration

Place a `.vigilrc` file in your project root (or any ancestor directory):

```toml
# .vigilrc
disabled_rules = ["VGL-T001"]        # skip trivy scan for this project
min_severity   = "HIGH"              # only report HIGH and above
exclude_paths  = ["vendor", "legacy"]
telemetry      = false               # opt out of anonymous local telemetry
```

Valca walks up the directory tree to find the nearest `.vigilrc`. Child config always wins over parent. Monorepos can have per-project overrides alongside a workspace default.

**Inline suppression** — for a specific line you've reviewed and accepted:

```python
auto_approve = True  # vigil: ignore
```

Same pattern as `# noqa` (flake8) and `# nosec` (bandit).

---

## Opt-out

Valca collects anonymous, local-only telemetry: rule ID, severity, and file extension. No file paths, no code, no identifiable data. Stored at `~/.vigil/events.jsonl` — never sent anywhere.

Opt out permanently:

```bash
export VIGIL_NO_TELEMETRY=1
```

Or in `.vigilrc`:

```toml
telemetry = false
```

---

## Adding a Rule

```python
# src/vigil/rules/my_category.py
from pathlib import Path
from .base import Finding, Rule, Severity

class MyRule(Rule):
    id = "VGL-X001"
    name = "Descriptive rule name"
    severity = Severity.HIGH

    def applies_to(self, path: Path) -> bool:
        return path.suffix == ".yml"

    def check(self, path: Path) -> list[Finding]:
        findings = []
        for i, line in enumerate(path.read_text().splitlines(), 1):
            if "bad_pattern" in line:
                findings.append(Finding(
                    rule_id=self.id,
                    severity=self.severity,
                    message="Found bad pattern",
                    file_path=path,
                    line=i,
                    snippet=line.strip(),
                    fix="Do this instead.",
                ))
        return findings
```

Then add it to `DEFAULT_RULES` in `src/vigil/rules/__init__.py`. Write tests. Done.

---

## GitHub Actions

Add Valca to any CI pipeline — copy `vigil-action/workflow-template.yml` into your project's `.github/workflows/vigil.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Install Valca
  run: pip install valca --quiet

- name: Scan with Valca
  run: valca scan . --no-color

- name: Upload SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: vigil-results.sarif
```

Findings appear as inline annotations on PR diffs in the GitHub Security tab.

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigilsec-io/cordon.git
cd vigil
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v
```
